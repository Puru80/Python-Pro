# Caching Proxy Server

This is a simple caching proxy server CLI tool built with Python and Click. The server forwards requests to a specified origin server, caches the responses, and returns cached responses for duplicate requests. This can help reduce load on the origin server and improve response times for repeat requests.

## Features

- **Request Forwarding**: Forwards client requests to a specified origin server.
- **Response Caching**: Caches the origin server responses, serving cached responses for repeated requests.
- **Cache Headers**: Adds headers to indicate whether the response is from the cache or the origin server.
- **Clear Cache**: Supports a CLI command to clear the cache.
